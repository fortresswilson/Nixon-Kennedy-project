        <p>On the morning of September 26, 1960, John F. Kennedy was a relatively unknown
            senator from Massachusetts. He was young and Catholic — neither of which helped
            his image — and facing off against an incumbent. But by the end of the evening, 
            he was a star.</p>
            <p>It's now common knowledge that without the nation's first televised debate —
                fifty years ago Sunday — Kennedy would never have been president. But beyond
                securing his presidential career, the 60-minute duel between the handsome Irish-
                American senator and Vice President Richard Nixon fundamentally altered political
                campaigns, television media and America's political history. "It's one of those
                unusual points on the timeline of history where you can say things changed very 
                dramatically — in this case, in a single night," says Alan Schroeder, a media
                historian and associate professor at Northeastern University, who authored the
                book, Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV </p>
            <p>Kennedy's aide and speech writer, Ted Sorensen remembers prepping the
                candidate for the big night. They were on the roof of their Chicago hotel,
                running through a pile of note cards, quizzing Kennedy on the likely debate
                topics while he worked on his tan. "We knew the first televised debate was 
                important, but we had no idea how important it was going to turn out," 
                Sorensen told TIME. After hours of practice and a speech before a labor
                union, the senator went in to take a nap. "The story I like to tell is of
                when they delegated me to go wake him up," Sorensen said. "I opened the door
            and peaked in and there he was, lights on, sound asleep, covered in notecards."

            What happened after the two candidates took the stage is a familiar tale. Nixon, 
            pale and underweight from a recent hospitalization, appeared sickly and sweaty,
            while Kennedy appeared calm and confident. As the story goes, those who listened
            to the debate on the radio thought Nixon had won. But those listeners were in
            the minority. By 1960, 88% of American households had televisions — up from just
            11% the decade before. The number of viewers who tuned in to the debate has been
            estimated as high as 74 million, by the Nielsen of the day, Broadcast Magazine.
            Those that watched the debate on TV thought Kennedy was the clear winner.
            Many say Kennedy won the election that night. Sorensen says the Kennedy team
            didn't realize what a game changer the debate was until the following day at a
            campaign event in Ohio. "The crowds for his motorcade were much larger than they'd
            ever been," he says. "That's when we knew that, if nothing else, Kennedy had
            firmed up support for himself in the Democratic party."

            Nixon performed much better in the subsequent debates (and appeared better thank
            to the "milkshake diet" his aides put him on to fatten him up). But, as Schroeder
            says, the damage had been done. "You couldn't wipe away the image people had seared
            in their brains from the first debate." Even Kennedy acknowledged the medium's 
            role in his victory. On November 12, 1960, four days after winning the election
            by a narrow margin, he said, "It was the TV more than anything else that turned
            the tide." Post-debate, candidates could no longer afford to ignore the potential
            power of television. "With the Nation Watching," a 1979 task force report, notes,
            "The Nixon-Kennedy debates made televised encounters between candidates the hottest
            thing in electioneering since the campaign button."

            Up to that point, politics had not really been played out on television. "It was
            very much an entertainment medium," says Schroeder. "It wasn't a place for 
            serious discourse." The next televised presidential debate wouldn't take place 
            for 16 years, largely because candidates became wary of their influence. Lyndon
            B. Johnson was too intimidated by the medium to take on Barry Goldwater in 1964,
            and Nixon, having been burned before, refused to debate on TV in both 1968 and
            1972. Televised debates reemerged 1976, when incumbent president Gerald Ford
            agreed to take on his Democratic challenger, Jimmy Carter.They've been standard
            practice in each campaign season since.

            After the debate, how you presented yourself, what you looked like, how you
            sounded and whether you connected directly with audiences mattered, says Larry
            Sabato, political analyst at the Center for Politics at the University of 
            Virginia and author of the forthcoming book, The Kennedy Half-Century.
            "Before the television debates most Americans didn't even see the candidates —
            they read about them, they saw photos of them," he told TIME. "This allowed the
            public to judge candidates on a completely different basis." It's a reality that
            continues to influence campaigns today. "When parties are considering their 
            candidates they ask: Who would look better on TV? Who comes across better?
            Who can debate better?" Sabato says. "This has been taken into the calculus."

            Beyond what the debate meant for the political arena, by catapulting Kennedy to
            the presidency, Sorensen speculates it fundamentally altered the world as we 
            know it. In 1962, President Kennedy famously refused the recommendation by the 
            Joint Chiefs of Staff to respond, militarily, to the Soviet Union's placing of 
            nuclear missiles in Cuba. Sorensen said he is sure Nixon would have taken the 
            Joint Chiefs advice ("he was more hawkish on military matters," he says). 
            "Had [Nixon] done as the Joint Chiefs urged it would have started a nuclear war
            from which nobody would have survived," Sorensen said. "I think we should
            certainly be grateful that John F. Kennedy won that debate."
